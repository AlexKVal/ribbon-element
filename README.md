- the ribbon element as on the guides.emberjs.com but made with CSS
- SCSS is used
- [Prism.JS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) for syntax highlighting is used

It is also possible to use two other popular syntax highlighters:
- Craig Campbell's [rainbow](https://github.com/ccampbell/rainbow) ([commit ecb2e7](https://github.com/AlexKVal/ribbon-element/commit/631bf8949e5f672b83ffe5c1524b1d6cceecb2e7))
- Ivan Sagalaev's [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) ([commit 07f174](https://github.com/AlexKVal/ribbon-element/commit/aca18fb9bc423184e93a255c5582475e8707f174))
